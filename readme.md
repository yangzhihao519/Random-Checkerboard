This code is used to create two checkerboard patterns that are almost identical except one minor difference in web browser.

## You can customize:

The Number of the set of image to be generated: `setNumber`.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in Web browser, the image will start to be downloaded. 

## Results

Pattern 2

Can you find out the difference between these two images?

Potentially the images could be used for ["Match-to-sample task"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match-to-sample_task).
